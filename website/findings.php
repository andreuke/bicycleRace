            <p>The usage of divvy bikes is obviously affected by the weather, but the major factor that affects usage is not the temperature, it's weather conditions. <br>
            Using the applications, the line charts clearly shows how, as instance, thunderstorms, heavy rains and snow highly affects the number of trips by decreasing them. <br>
            This behavoir is observable from the line charts below. Notiche that whenever the weather get worse the number of bike decreases, while when the weather gets better the usage goes up.<br>

          However, also the temperature has a big influence on bikes' usage: the average number of trips decreases with the diminishing of the temperature. <br>
            One example of this could be seen by looking at weekends. When the temperature is low, people prefer not to use bikes and the usage collapse. For what concern week days, 
            there is a completely different behavior. 
            Also even when temperature is low, people use divvy bikes in their everyday trips.
