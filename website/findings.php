          Here we focus on the findings and patterns related to six Divvy stations close to the University of Illinois at Chicago West Campus. <br>
          The stations we considered are:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Loomis & Taylor</b></li>
            <li><b>May & Taylor</b></li>
            <li><b>Racine & Congress</b></li>
            <li><b>Morgan & Polk</b></li>
            <li><b>900 Harrison</b></li>
            <li><b>Halsted & Polk</b></li>
          </ul>
          The first feature, shared among all the stations is the age range, as observable from one of the pictures below.

        <p>
          The majority of people that uses bikes in these stations is between 18 and 28 years old. 
          Notice that this is the age range of graduate and undergraduate students and, as we are considering 
          stations near University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), this means that these stations are mainly used by students.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        The second observable thing is that the majority of people are subscribers, not customers. Subscribers pay a subscription for an entire year.<br>
        This is explainable by the fact that these station are used mainly by students as they need a means of transportation over a long period of time, not only for some days.<br>
        By the way, it is also known that there is a student discount for the annual membership, and this surely influences the number of student subscribers.
        </p>
        <p>        
        If we focus on the gender, we can notice that it follows the general flow. The majority of people who uses bikes in these stations are males.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Circled in red we show the stations we considered. The following map pictures show the inflow and outflow of one of those six stations.

            The ticker the line is the more trips happen between the two connected stations. 
            We can infer that those Divvy users move to and from places really close to the University campus. 
            Those Subscribers basically have their place in the area and work or study in the same area.

          However, also the temperature has a big influence on bikes' usage: the average number of trips decreases with the diminishing of the temperature. <br>
            One example of this could be seen by looking at weekends. When the temperature is low, people prefer not to use bikes and the usage collapse. For what concern week days, 
            there is a completely different behavior. 
            Also even when temperature is low, people use divvy bikes in their everyday trips.

            In the linecharts above, is noticeable that sometimes, usually in weekdays, the sunrise is not very relevant. In fact, the number of trips starts growing before the sun rises.
            What we can observe from the line chart on the left that, during weekends, almost no one uses the bikes before the sun rises  .
            <br>
            One conclusion, that can be derived from these considerations, is that bikes usage is related to work hours. This is derivable from the fact that, during weekdays,
            number of bikes start growing before the sun rises, hence when people usually go to work.
