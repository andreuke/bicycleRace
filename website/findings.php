          <p> While analyzing and visualizing the data we noticed serveral things, some curious some others quite strange </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b> Customer Age </b> : Most of the customers are between 20 and 35 years old. </li>
            <li><b> Strange Trips </b> : There is a total 278 trips made by people older than 100 years</li>
            <li><b> Typical Trip Time </b> : A Typical trip lasts less than 15 minutes </li>
            <li><b> Mean Trip Distance </b> : Most of the trips are between 1'000 and 4'000 meters </li>
            <li><b> Weekly Usage </b> : There are more rides during the weekend </li>
            <li><b> Busiest Day </b> : Most of the trips happen on Saturday </li>
            <li><b> Busiest period of the year</b> : Most trips happen between August and mid October. However we have to consider that the service was launched in July so July's data is not relevant</li>
            <li><b> Customer VS Subscriber </b> : There are more subscribers than customers </li>
            <li><b> Subscriber Gender </b> : Male subscribers are three times more than female subscriber </li>
            <li><b> Busiest period of the day </b> : Bikes are used principally from 6:30am to 7pm, but the peak is from 3pm to 7pm </li>

        <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>
          Here we focus on 6 Divvy stations and we analyze the patterns we find. <br>
          The stations we are considering are:
          <ul>
            <li>Loomis & Taylor </li>
            <li>May st & Taylor </li>
            <li>Racine & Congress </li>
            <li>Morgan & Polk </li>
            <li>900 Harrison </li>
            <li>Halsted & Polk</li>
          </ul>
          The first feature, shared among all the stations is the age range. As observable from the picture below, (IMMAGINE MORGAN&POLK) the majority of people
          that uses bikes in theese stations is between 18 and 28. Notice that this is the age range of graduate and undergraduate students and as we are considering 
          stations near University of Illinois at Chicago, this means that theese stations are used mainly by students.<br>

          <br>
          The second thing observable, is that the majority of people are subscribers, and not customer. So, they are paying for the entire year and not only for a day.<br>
          This is explainable by the fact that theese station are used mainly by students and they need a transport for the entire year, not only for some days.<br>
          By the way, is known that there is a student discount for the annual membership. This is clearly related to the fact that the majority of people in theese stations are Subscribers, 
          as they are frequented mainly by students.
          <br>
          <br>
          If we focus on the gender, we can notice that it follows the general flow. The majority of people who uses bikes in theese stations are Male.<br>

            <li> Average number of trips decrease with temperature. </li>-->
            <p>The usage of divvy bikes is obviously affected by the weather, but the major factor that affects usage is not the temperature, it's weather conditions. <br>
            Using the applications, the line charts clearly shows how, as instance, thunderstorms, heavy rains and snow highly affects the number of trips by decreasing them. <br>
            This behavoir is observable from the line charts below. Notiche that whenever the weather get worse the number of bike decreases, while when the weather gets better the usage goes up.<br>

          However, also the temperature has a big influence on bikes' usage: the average number of trips decreases with the diminishing of the temperature. <br>
            One example of this could be seen by looking at weekends. When the temperature is low, people prefer not to use bikes and the usage collapse. For what concern week days, 
            there is a completely different behavior. 
            Also even when temperature is low, people use divvy bikes in their everyday trips.

            <p>The first thing noticeable is that bike usage usually decreases after the sun sets. The influence of the sunrise is not as high as expected. <br>
              There are a lot of trips, in fact, starting before the sunrise. The overall trend, however, shows that the majority of trips is made during the day, while, when the sun sets people tend to not use the bike. <br>

          </div>
          <p>
            In the linecharts above, is noticeable that sometimes, usually in weekdays, the sunset is not very relevant. In fact, the number of trips starts growing before it.
            What we can observe from the second line chart, that shows trips in a weekend day, is that no one is using bike before the sun sets.
            <br>
            One conclusion, that can be derived from theese considerations, is that bikes usage is related to work hours. This is derivable from the fact that, during weekdays,
            number of bikes start growing before the sun rises, period when usually people go working.
